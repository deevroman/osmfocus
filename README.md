# OSMfocus Reborn

OSMfocus Reborn is an open source tool for examining OpenStreetMap elements by moving around on a map.  
Written in Kotlin using Android Jetpack.

![Feature Graphic](images/featuregfx.png)

Move the crosshair in the middle of the map over a building or road to view its keys and values. A line will be drawn connecting the element with a box on the side of the screen. This box contains every tag of the element in OpenStreetMap. Use this information to find bugs or investigate to an area closer.
